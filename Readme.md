# Gantt for DevExtreme - Planned vs actual tasks  

This example demonstrates how to display both actual and planned tasks in the Gantt chart area.

![Gantt planned and actual tasks](/gantt-planned-vs-actual-tasks.png)

The Gantt data source contains [four date fields](./CS/DevExtremeMvcApp1/Models/GanttDataProvider.cs#L140): two of them contain planned dates for a task and the other two are filled based on real dates of each task.

The [taskContentTemplate](https://js.devexpress.com/jQuery/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxGantt/Configuration/#taskContentTemplate) property is used to display two visual elements for one task.

The main idea is to create two HTML div elements and add them to a task container. The first element represents [planned](./CS/DevExtremeMvcApp1/Views/Home/Index.cshtml#L75) tasks. It is created based on the taskSize parameter.

The second element is for an actual task. Its size and position are [calculated](./CS/DevExtremeMvcApp1/Views/Home/Index.cshtml#L105) based on task data. Appearance of actual tasks is defined by the [actual-task](./CS/DevExtremeMvcApp1/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml#L25) class.
